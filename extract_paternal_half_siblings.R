######## ESTIMATING HERITABILITY BASED ON THE INTRACLASS Â§CORRELATION OF GESTATIONAL AGE BETWEEN PATERNAL HALF SIBLINGS

# STEP 1: estimating the correlation between paternal half siblings by:
  # 1.1 multilevel analysis
  # 1.2 taking randomly the half sibling pair from a one father, many times, calculate corr each time, and at the end take a mean of those values (?)
# STEP 2: estimating the heritability by multiplying corr coefficient by 4 (arrive from theory of heritability)
